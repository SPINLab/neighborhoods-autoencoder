# The Neighborhoods generator project!

## Goal
 To generate (or 'hallucinate') neighborhoods based on the distribution of neighborhoods, and the roads and buildings within them.
 
## Why?
- Because it is very interesting to see what a deep neural net can learn as a representation of some kind of high-dimensional data distribution
- Also: generating semi-real world geospatial information objects could help spatial planners to be inspired by auto-generated neighbourhood layouts.

# TODO
- [x] Get the neighborhoods data
- [ ] Create a vector representation of neighborhoods to use in a machine learning model
